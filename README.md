## What is The Donut Project?

Watch the introduction video [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txWCx1ku_2U).

This all started with [donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html), the classic C code that looks like, and generates a 3D spinning donut when run. Out of sheer curiosity, I searched up this code in different languages, and noticed that many people have created 3D spinning donuts in those languages... but their code mostly didn't look like a donut.

My goal at the start was to bring this classic piece of code (and its donut shape) to different languages. I started with a [JavaScript rendition of donut.c](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/donut-js). Then, after much struggle, I created a [Python version](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/donut-py).

Because I thought it would be fun, I posted both of these projects on YouTube, and to my surprise, it caught on quickly, [getting around 90k views in 2 weeks—and counting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzpfyTFvU6M). People started asking me to make this in different languages. And now I'm asking _you_.

The Donut Project seeks to replicate donut.c in as many languages as possible, and it's really quite easy to join...

## How do I contribute?

You can either...

- [Contribute your own donut](#contribute-your-own-donut)
- [Contribute someone else's donut](#contribute-someone-elses-donut)

### Contribute Your own Donut

Do so in 2 easy steps:

#### Step 1: Bake Your Donut

First, find a language that someone hasn't done yet (you can see the finished languages in the `donuts` folder or `info.json`) and recreate donut.c!

##### Helpful resources:
* [Donut.c blog](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html)
* [Library-less donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2021/01/13/optimizing-donut.html)

##### Alternate-Implementation Donuts

If you would like to contribute a donut in a language someone has already done with your own spin to it, write the file like this: `donut.[TYPE].[EXTENSION]` with a JSON key in `info.json` of `[TYPE].[EXTENSION]`. For example, if you were to make a JS donut only using fixed-point arithmetic (so-called being "pure"), you may call it `donut.pure.js` with a JSON key of `pure.js`. Ensure you place in the PR why you believe this donut is unique enough to be its own separate file.
Additionally, please include a short summary in the `description` of why this donut is special.

##### Basic Rules

- Make sure that the output is similar to the original donut.c.
- Also, importantly, make sure that the code looks like a donut. To make this easier you can use [`donutGenerator`](./tools/README.md#donutgenerator).

##### Recommendations

Additionally, here are some (decently strong) recommendations about how you should make your donut:

- Make sure the donut is mostly code. It's alright if there are a few lines/places with comments, however.

#### Step 2: Submit Your Donut

Now, fork this repo with the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/TheDonutProject.git
```

Add your donut to the `donuts` folder. Ensure it is named `donut`, with the proper extension at the end. For example, I may have the file `donut.py`, `donut.js`, or `donut.pure.js` (as mentioned above).

Then, add an entry into `info.json`. The key should be whatever file extension (and potentially additional suffixes) you are using (make sure it matches with your file—it should be everything that follows `donut.`), and the value should look like this:

| Key           | Description                                                           | Required?                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | Your name, or name you would like to associate your donut with        | **Required**                                                                        |
| `github`      | Your GitHub account                                                   | _Optional_                                                                          |
| `repo`        | Full link to your GitHub repository where you have your donut         | _Optional_                                                                          |
| `run`         | Command to run your donut with; refer to the file simply as `donut.*` | _Required if special action needed (i.e. compiler flags, etc.)_                     |
| `description` | Describe your donut.                                                  | _Required for [alternate-implementation donuts](#alternate-implementation-donuts)._ |

For example, my `donut.js` would look something like this:

> Please use 4 space indentation in `info.json`.

```json
"js": {
    "name": "Evan Zhou",
    "github": "EvanZhouDev",
    "repo": "https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/donut-js"
}
```

Finally, simply submit a PR (with the language you are contributing in the title), and go through the checklist to complete your submission.

### Contribute Someone Else's Donut

Alternatively, you can also submit donuts that you have found floating around the community already. Ensure that it still follows the [basic rules](#basic-rules) and [recommendations](#recommendations).

Submit it just the same [as above](#step-2-submit-your-donut), but make sure you put _their name_ and _their GitHub and repo_ if applicable in the `info.json`.
